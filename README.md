# implicit-hie-cradle

Auto generate `stack` or `cabal` multi component [`hie-bios`](https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios) `Cradle`s.
This library is used by `ghcide`, unless you know what `hie-bios`'s `Cradle` type is, you're probably looking for the `gen-hie` command line utility contained in the [implicit-hie](https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/implicit-hie) package.
